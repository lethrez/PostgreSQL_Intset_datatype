 ******************************************************************************
  This file contains routines that can be bound to a Postgres backend and
  called by the backend in the process of processing queries.  The calling
  format for these routines is dictated by Postgres architecture.
  
  The structure is defined in intset.c and intset.source has the source utilised via 
  the makefial defined in /src/tutorial/Makefile.
  
  NOTE: the following lines must be changed to include intset (lines 16,17)
  MODULES = complex funcs intset
  DATA_built = advanced.sql basics.sql complex.sql funcs.sql syscat.sql intset.sql
  
  Once created the SQL file is simply imported into PostgreSQL (\i intset.sql) 
  when in the working directory

  
  Implementation could be optimized through an index wrapper data structure to make
  searches such as binary search and ordering more efficient.
  This would allow binary search when calling functions.
  The file is not incredibly optimized as it was a learning excercise for the 
  backend of postgreSQL.
